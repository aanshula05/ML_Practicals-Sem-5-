This repository contains various Machine Learning algorithms implemented by me in my Machine Learning Practicals in college

* Experiment 1 - Find S Algorithm
> Find S algorithm is a basic concept learning algorithm and it finds the most specific hypothesis which fits all the positive samples.
> Find S algorithm only considers the positive samples and it moves from most specific hypothesis to most general hypothesis.

* Experiment 2 - Candidate Elimination Algorithm

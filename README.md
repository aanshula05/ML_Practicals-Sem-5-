This repository contains various Machine Learning algorithms implemented by me in my Machine Learning Practicals in college

* Find S Algorithm
> Find S algorithm is a basic concept learning algorithm and it finds the most specific hypothesis which fits all the positive samples.
> Find S algorithm only considers the positive samples and it moves from most specific hypothesis to most general hypothesis.

* Candidate Elimination Algorithm
> This was designed to overcome disadvantages of Find S algorithm. Candidate Elimination algorithm is based on Version Space concept.
> This considers both positive & negative samples as well as both general & specific hypothesis
> For each positive sample move from specific to general and vice versa for negative sample
